# Database showcase
Overview: This project showcases my Python coding skills in managing experimental data for biological studies. It encompasses scripts for setting up a SQLite database, importing data from CSV files, and populating the SQLite database.

## Features:
### Database Schema:
The schema.png file illustrates the logical data model. 

### Database Setup:
The DBsetup_pandas_2.py file contains the script responsible for creating the tables according to the schema.

### Data Import:
The DB_insertData_final.py script facilitates reading CSV files and loading the data into the pre-configured database. It prompts the user for filenames, allowing multiple files to be provided at once.

## Learnings:
This Project shows a lot of my skills and forced me to repeat many details I've learned. It represents one of the most independent projects I've tackled to date, prompting me to reconsider numerous ideas along the way. There's still room for improvement, but through this endeavor, I've leveraged a wide array of skills acquired through my studies, including general Python coding, handling Panda dataframes, and writing SQLite statements.

## Datastructure:

### Input data:
For the Data Import one or multiple CSV files can be loaded. Each file needs the following names as header: "ExperimentID", "name", "area", "Sphase_filter", "area_filter", "ImageNumb", "Z", "c2_median", "well_ID", "c4_FociCount". The ExperimentID has to be of the format "XX000_PLA" or "XX000_IF" depending on the type of Experiment. The header "c4_FociCount" is optional but has to be included it the Experiment ID ends in "PLA".

### Database:
The database is built upon microscopic data collected during my Bachelor's thesis. The data originates from two distinct experiments conducted using confocal laser microscopy. Each experiment was conducted within 96-well plates. Within these plates, multiple wells shared identical conditions, which could vary between different drugs and treatment durations.
Using image analysis software, individual cells were identified, and the cell areas were calculated. Additionally, for each cell, the median intensity of the second channel was determined ("c2_median"). For the "PLA" experiments, the number of foci per cell was also computed.
These metrics facilitated comparisons between treatments and their respective effects. 
With the experimental and analytical context in mind, I devised the schema. Since the data is analyzed per cell, the primary table containing this data is the "cell" table. To facilitate comparisons between experiments and conditions, the "experiment" and "treatment" tables store relevant information.
To maintain data integrity, four different foreign keys were applied to represent experiment type, treatment type, S-phase filter, and area filter.
After careful consideration and learning, I settled on this setup. In this design, the red tables contain enum like data. There were multiple possible approaches, each with its own pros and cons. For instance, in this setup, the IDs of most tables are text values rather than integers and taken from the data rather than autogenerated. While this could potentially slow down the lookup process, it enabled smoother loading of data into the database. Additionaly, it makes the database more human-readable
