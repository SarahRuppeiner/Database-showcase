# Database showcase
Overview: This project showcases my Python coding skills in managing experimental data for biological studies. It encompasses scripts for setting up a SQLite database, importing data from CSV files, and populating the SQLite database.

## Features:
### Database Schema:
The schema.png file illustrates the logical data model. After careful consideration and learning, I settled on this setup. In this design, the red tables contain enum like data. There were multiple possible approaches, each with its own pros and cons. For instance, in this setup, the IDs of most tables are text values rather than integers and taken from the Data rather than autogenerated. While this could potentially slow down the lookup process, it enabled smoother loading of data into the database. Additionaly, it makes the database more human-readable.

### Database Setup:
The DBsetup_pandas_2.py file contains the script responsible for creating the tables according to the schema.

### Data Import:
The DB_insertData_final.py script facilitates reading CSV files and loading the data into the pre-configured database. It prompts the user for filenames, allowing multiple files to be provided at once.

## Learnings:
This Project shows a lot of my skills and forced me to repeat many details I've learned. It represents one of the most independent projects I've tackled to date, prompting me to reconsider numerous ideas along the way. There's still room for improvement, but through this endeavor, I've leveraged a wide array of skills acquired through my studies, including general Python coding, handling Panda dataframes, and writing SQLite statements.
